Day1:Data Type
  Today, we're discussing data types. 

Day2:Operators
  In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators.

Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements
  In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. 

Day 4: Class vs. Instance
  In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance; 
  because this is an Object Oriented concept, it's only enabled in certain languages. 

Day 5: Loops
  In this challenge, we will use loops to do some math. That is to print multiplication table.

Day 6: Let's Review
  Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops. 

Day 7: Arrays
  Today, we will learn about the Array data structure. 

Day 8: Dictionaries and Maps
  Today, we're learning about Key-Value pair mappings using a Map or Dictionary data structure. 

Day 9: Recursion 3
  Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion.
